the minesweeper that I created has 2 modes. one of the modes is for the minesweeper asked for in the project
specifically in its revealMines it only finds the first mine. However, in my other implementation of the game,
your first coordinate reveals all zeros around it and makes a border for you to start(like actual minesweeper)
within you will find 2 guess methods(guess and guess1), 2 reveal zero methods(revealZero and revealZero1) and
2 reveal mine methods (revealMine and revealMine1). the 1 indicates that it is the way the project wants us to do it.
hope you enjoy
