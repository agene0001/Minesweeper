# Minesweeper
By Felix Agene
## Introduction
This is a project initially created for my class but slowly added more features and I'm even developing an AI to play the game
The minesweeper that I created for my class project has 2 modes. One of the modes is for implementation of minesweeper asked for in the project directions, in specific in the methods revealMines. 
The other mode plays more like the actual game and will be the mode that I train the AI on. 
## Algorithms
## GUI
## AI
within you will find 2 guess methods(guess and guess1), 2 reveal zero methods(revealZero and revealZero1) and
2 reveal mine methods (revealMine and revealMine1). the 1 indicates that it is the way the project wants us to do it.
hope you enjoy
